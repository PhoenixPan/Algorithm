## Backtracking & DFS & Recursion
If we have an actual tree or graph data structure, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree searching. 在树和图上回溯时为DFS  
Most questions can be resolved using recursion or stack.  

Situations:  
1. Find a path to success 有没有解
2. Find all paths to success 求所有解
3. Find the best path to success 求最优解
