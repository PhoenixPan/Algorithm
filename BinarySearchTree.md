##BST basic  
Full binary tree: each node is either a leaf or has degree exactly 2.  
A complete k-ary tree is a k-ary tree in which all leaves have the same depth and all internal nodes have degree k.

Remove from a binary tree: replace with the smallest node from its right subtree or the largest node from its left subtree.  
In a complete tree:
Number of leafs: (n+1) /2
Number of internal nodes: N â€“ above = (n-1)/2
